# React Gallery

## Description

This is a simple photo gallery built using React. The interface allows you to add photos to a page with a description. Clicking on the photo will toggle between showing the description and showing the photo. A user can also like a photo or delete a photo.

- I found this project to be easier than expected. The base mode of instructions I actually completed in about 2 hours. This left me plenty of time to dig in to MaterialUI.
- If there was any difficulty or challenge it was in learning the basics of MaterialUI. I was able to add some basic styling but would have loved to add more and dig into the inner workings of MaterialUI more in order to better understand how it works.
